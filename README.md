## Software and Platform 

* All code used the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) language:
* All code was run on a virtual machine in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which runs in Ubuntu Linux
  
* Packages Used: 
* EDA: [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/), and [seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)

## Documentation 
* Our data was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets/code) - it was too large to upload as a file onto GitHub
* Outputs can be found in our OUTPUTS folder

## How to Reproduce Results 
* To reproduce these results:
* First download the cleaned CSV - located in our DATA folder and run our master files in the OUTPUTS folder
